## Introduction

Obsessed with order? Spotify artists upload the same song over and over again and you're losing track? We are here for you.

With our app, you could use the following tools:

💥 Find duplicates that Spotify misses by comparing songs' title and asrtists' name.<br/>
💥 Find remixes and covers from the same artist.<br/>
💥 Remove the songs you don't want from your playlists directly from our app.<br/>

## Built With
